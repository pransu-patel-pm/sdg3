  <h2>About This Platform</h2>
  <p>
    This web-based system is designed to record and monitor
    common health issues and environmental problems in a village.
    The goal is to support <b>preventive health care</b> by identifying
    patterns related to illness, sanitation, and surroundings.
  </p>
  <p>
    All data collected is <b>anonymous</b> and used only for awareness,
    monitoring, and planning purposes.

  <h2>Why Preventive Health Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Many health problems do not appear suddenly. They develop over time
    due to factors such as poor sanitation, stagnant water, improper waste
    disposal, and seasonal changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    By observing early signs and environmental conditions, communities
    can take action <b>before</b> illnesses become serious.
